# VW-SDK : An Efficient Convolutional Weight Mapping Algorithm Using Shifted and Duplicated Kernel with Variable Windows.
---
## Abstract
With their high energy efficiency, processing-in-memory (PIM) arrays are increasingly being used for convolutional neural network (CNN) inference. In PIM-based CNN inference, the computational latency and energy are dependent on how the CNN weights are mapped to the PIM array.
A recent study proposed shifted and duplicated kernel (SDK) mapping that reuses the input feature maps with a unit of a parallel window, which is convolved with duplicated kernels to obtain multiple output elements in parallel.
However, the existing SDK-based mapping algorithm does not always result in the minimum computing cycles because it only maps a square-shaped parallel window with the entire channels.
In this paper, we introduce a novel mapping algorithm called variable-window SDK (VW-SDK), which adaptively determines the shape of the parallel window that leads to the minimum computing cycles for a given convolutional layer and PIM array.
By allowing rectangular-shaped windows with partial channels, VW-SDK better utilizes PIM array, thereby further reducing the number of computing cycles.
The simulation with a 512x512 PIM array and Resnet-18 shows that VW-SDK improves the inference speed by 1.69x compared to the existing SDK-based algorithm.

## Requirements
+ python3.x+

## Usage

### main.ipynb
* This code calculates the computing cycle according to the mapping methods (im2col, SDK, VW-SDK).

### Example
With list, you have to input the PIM array size.
ex) [rows, columns]

And then, choice the network.

In these form, you can input other networks.

## Results
These tables show the computing cycles according to the convolutional layer.
We set the array size to 512x512, bit precision to 1.

## Mapping methods

### Im2col (Image to column)
You can read the original pdf [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2964284.2967243)

Each kernel with size KxKxIC (where K is kernel, IC is input channel) is unrolled into the column. A kernel-sized window in an input feature map (IFM) is convolved with the kernel.


### SDK (Shift and Duplicate Kernel)
You can read the original pdf [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9104658)

This mapping computes multiple windows instead of single window simultaneously in each cycle. To reuses the input data, this method forms the parallel window that is a set of windows. Thus, it obtains multiple output feature maps (OFMs) by utilizing the PIM array.
